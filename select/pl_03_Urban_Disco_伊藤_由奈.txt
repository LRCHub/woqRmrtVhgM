I will change to be back...
I will change to be back again to you
I will change to be back...
If you never try to be the best
If you don't know about her
everything I don't know
never lose it on your faith
'cause I need to change
I call
1234
love
hate
fighting
think safe
right
9-10
escape from trouble to something
clap your beat
dancing to your soul
(so) I am DISCO
excite, like a electric wave
try again
dance to the love
(so) I am DISCO
excite, like a electric wave
right here!
right now!
right here!
